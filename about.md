*Nami Island, Chuncheon, South Korea*

My name is Duc Bui (English: Duke, Vietnamese: Bùi Hoàng Đức, Chinese: 裴皇德, Korean: 부이황득)

I was born on June, 1987.
While Vietnam imposed the “[two-child policy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Two-child_policy)”, I have another older brother.
My memory begins at my parents’ home in Mai Dong, Hanoi, where we lived in a very little apartment of 9 square meters.
We later moved to a big house on Nguyen Chi Thanh Street.

*Nguyen Chi Thanh Street, Hanoi, Vietnam*

Due to major political changes in 1990s, our family moved again, and eventually, settled down in Bach Khoa Ward, home of Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

I went to Daejeon in South Korea in August 2010.
I had hobbies in photography, running and hiking. I hiked the 800-meter [Gyeryong-san 雞龍山](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gyeryongsan) mountain for more than 60 times, about once per month on average.

I spent 6 months doing internship at Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing. I also have chance to visit Europe for presenting my papers at MobiCom conference.

After 7 years studying in South Korea, I finally moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, in August 2017 where I am currently working towards a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science.
