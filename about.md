*Nami island, South Korea*

My name is Duc Bui (English: Duke, Vietnamese: Bùi Hoàng Đức, Chinese: 裴皇德, Korean: 부이황득)

I was born on June, 1987.
While Vietnam imposed the “[two-child policy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Two-child_policy)”, I have another older brother who is 8 years older than me.
My memory begins at my parents’ home in Mai Dong, Hanoi, where we lived in a very little apartment of 9 square meters.
We later moved to a big house on Nguyen Chi Thanh Street.

*Nguyen Chi Thanh Street, Hanoi*

Due to major political changes in 1990s, our family moved again, and eventually, settled down in Bach Khoa Ward, home of Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

I went to Daejeon in South Korea in August 2010.
After 7 years studying in South Korea, I finally moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, in August 2017 where I am currently working towards a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science.
