# Transfer Learning
There are 3 main research problems in transfer learning [3]:
* What to transfer
* How to transfer
* When to transfer

In tradition approaches, there are 3 main approaches (Li [1]), for domain adaptation in NLP:
* Feature space transformation
* Prior-based adaptation
* Instance selection and weighting

In modern approaches, there are 4 popular approaches (Ruder [2]):
* Pre-trained CNN features
* Learn domain-invariant representations
* Making representations more similar
* Confusing domains
